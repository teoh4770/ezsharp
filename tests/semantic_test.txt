Here's a simplified list of semantic tests based on the examples:

- Type Mismatch in Assignment: Assigning a value of the wrong type to a variable.

- Undeclared Variable: Using a variable that has not been declared.

- Function Return Type Mismatch: Returning a value of the wrong type from a function.

- Function Parameter Type Mismatch: Passing arguments of the wrong type to a function.

- Invalid Boolean Expression: Using non-boolean expressions in conditional statements (if, while).

- Array Index Type Mismatch: Using a non-integer type as an array index.

- Type Mismatch in Comparison: Comparing incompatible data types.

- Missing Return Value: Not returning a value from a function declared with a non-void type.

- Redeclaration Error: Declaring the same variable with a different type.

- Incorrect Number of Function Arguments: Calling a function with too few or too many arguments.
